# Containers - A primer

## Think shipping containers
- Standard unit of shipping.
- Stackable onto on a ship, train, plane or truck. ‚õ¥Ô∏è üöá ‚úàÔ∏è üöö
- Compatible worldwide.

![containers](https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/05/02/16/34/container-gantry-crane-1367601_960_720.jpg)

Application `containers` follow a similar philosophy.

## Application containers
- Standard unit of an application‚Äôs runtime.
  (files, libraries, dependencies, sockets, etc)
- Stackable onto a Linux, macOS or Windows Machine.
- Can run anything that would run on a server.

# Cybersecurity Principles and Containers

## Domain Separation
Good fences make good neighbors:

- We can separate an application's environment into 'fenced off neighbors'
- It is good to separate source code from runtime environment

## Modularization
Modular programming is a software design technique that emphasizes separating the functionality of a program into independent, interchangeable modules.

- Containers separate services from each other
  (Web service, Database, Application Server, etc)

## Resource Encapsulation
Encapsulation is an object oriented concept where all data and functions required to use the resource are packaged into a single self-contained component.

- Containers provide a standard interface between the
  host or other containers.
- They also only expose legitimate application interfaces.

## Process Isolation
Process Isolation keeps separate functions from accessing the same memory.
- Limit damage/crashes to a single container
- Processes in a container cannot directly access
  resources in another container

# Deploy, run and publish a container
## Your first container

Let‚Äôs start with a container based on [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org)

- Alpine Linux is a security-oriented, lightweight Linux distribution

First, we need to download a container blueprint called an ```Image```

- Open a Windows Powershell instance:

```bash
# Download alpine container image from Docker Hub
docker pull alpine
```
You should see some download activity. What just happened?

## Container images

[Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com) is a registry of images from authoritative sources and individual users

- By default, the `latest` image is downloaded. This label is called a Tag
- Other tags allows downloading specific versions or those shared by other users

Let‚Äôs check locally available images and note their sizes.   

```bash
# Check images available locally on your machine
docker images
```

> Observation: Docker images are much smaller than typical Virtual Machines  

## Running your first container

Let's create and start a container from the alpine image
```bash
# See list of docker commands
docker
# `run` executes a command in a new container (creates it too)
# -it provides an interactive tty shell into the container
# --name provides a name for your new container
# `alpine:latest` is the image name and its tag
docker run -it --name myAlpine alpine:latest
```
if the previous command was successful, the container is created and you are returned an interactive shell into the container. The shell looks like this: ```/ #```

## Explore the container

Try some commands in the container shell
```bash
# Some commands to try
whoami # enuf said!
cd /   # Switch to the root directory
ls -la # List contents of the root directory
ping google.com # Hit CRTL+C to exit
exit # Stop the shell to exit container
```

## Observations
- Host directories and files are inaccessible
- The container can connect to websites and receive responses
- You were running as `root` in the container!

## Cleanup
- Let's see the containers that we created. This command shows both running and stopped containers.
```bash
docker ps -a
```
- Using the name of a container we can delete containers that are stopped.
```bash
docker rm <container-ID or name>
```

# This is so cool‚Ä¶ üòé

# Manage container interactions

## Container volumes
- Containers are short-lived
- Code and data persist over longer periods
- Volumes are externally mapped storage areas for a container
  - Shared folders on host, Shared drives on network, etc.,

## Mount a host directory as a data volume

Volumes have to be initialized at container creation time
- The `-v` option mounts a volume

In a new ```Powershell```:
```bash
# Create a new host directory called app
mkdir app
# Host /app folder mapped to container /webapp folder
# `\` allows you to continue a long command on a new line
docker run -it --name myAlpineWithVol -v /c/Users/student/app:/webapp alpine:latest
```
You may get a prompt to share the C: drive with Docker. Accept that and enter the your account password. Once access is granted, a container shell will be returned.

## Volume configuration

Caution üò°:   
By default, a mounted volume allows full read/write by the container  
This allows exceptions to the `Process Isolation`  principle

- May set it to read-only (Least privilege principle)
  - `-v /c/Users/student/app:/webapp:ro`
- Caching option improves performance
  - `-v /c/Users/student/app:/webapp:cached`

## Test the mounted volume

In a new ```Powershell```:
```bash
# Change directory to the `/app` directory on the host
cd app
# Create a new file and add some text
set-content test.txt "Nebraska Gencyber Rocks"
```

Back in the ```container``` shell:
```bash
# List contents of the test.txt file
cat test.txt
# You should be able to see the file contents
```

> Observation: Container and host are able to share files.

It is always good stop containers when not in use to free up system resources.
In a new ```Powershell```:

```bash
# List all running containers
docker ps
# Stop a running container
docker stop myAlpineWithVol
```

### Totally cool‚Ä¶ ü§ì

## Exposing Container Services

Services are bound to container ports.
We need to expose container ports to the network to access these services remotely.

## An HTTP Server Container
Let‚Äôs create a container that runs an HTTP server in two commands!
First, download an image for Lighttpd from Docker Hub

In a new ```Powershell```:
```bash
# download a container for lighttpd, a lightweight HTTP server
docker pull gists/lighttpd
```
In a container spawned from this image, we need to expose Port 80 to access the web server.  
We do this by mapping the container‚Äôs port to a port of the host

## Host - Container Network
![Host-container network](./img/host-container-network.png)

## Host-Container Port Mapping

Port mappings have to be initialized at container creation time
- The `-p` option maps a host port to the container port

In ```Powershell```:

```bash
# -d option runs the container in detached mode (background)
# -p 8888:80 maps host port 8888 to container port 80
# -v maps the host app directory to the web directory in the container
docker run -d --name lighttpd -p 8888:80 -v /c/Users/student/app:/var/www gists/lighttpd
# Check the mapped port in container listing
docker ps -a

```

## Test the mapped port

Since we have a volume mapped, let's author a simple HTML index file and drop it in the web root of the container. We should be able to browse to this page if the port mapping works as expected.

In a new ```Powershell```:

```bash
# Change directory to the `/app` directory on the host
cd app
# Add a simple HTML file exclamation marks
set-content index.html "<html>My first Container App</html>"
```
Now browse to http://localhost:8888

## Testing continued‚Ä¶

Return to ```Powershell```:

```bash
# Update the HTML file
set-content index.html "<html><h1>Cool</h1></html>"
```
Now browse to http://localhost:8888

## Reflect on what just happened ü§î

> Observations:
- Separation of persistent code from the application runtime
- Host file updates are instantly reflected in the container application

### üòé Cool!

## Cleanup
Let's stop the container service and delete the container before we move on.
```bash
# Stop a running container named lighttpd
docker stop lighttpd

# Delete container named lighttpd
docker rm lighttpd

# List all containers (running or stopped)
docker ps -a

```

# Setting up a dev environment

## Container build automation
Typing long docker commands in a terminal is cumbersome üòñ  
Luckily, a `Dockerfile` automates the build process. This is Akin to a ‚Äúrecipe‚Äù that the Docker engine understands.

## Dockerfile
- Examine the `Dockerfile` for `gists/lighttpd` image that we pulled from Docker Hub earlier: https://github.com/iHavee/dockerfiles/blob/master/lighttpd/Dockerfile

- Here is a reference for Dockerfile directives: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/

## A Django Dockerfile

```bash
# Start with this base image
FROM python:2.7.13
# Set environment variables
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1
# Set the working directory in
# which RUN and CMD options will run
WORKDIR /var/www/backend
# RUN commands run at container build time
# Used to install applications
RUN pip install Django
RUN pip install djangorestframework
RUN pip install markdown
RUN pip install django-filter
RUN pip install psycopg2
```

## Basic automation workflow

### Step 1: Clone a repository
Let us clone a repository that includes the above DockerFile.  
The DockerFile is typically in the top level project directory. For this we are going to use a recent web server demo we used this summer in a GenCyber camp. The server was built to interact with little IoT devices and show events gathered from the device.

In a new ```Powershell```:
```bash
# Switch to Desktop
cd ~/Desktop

# Clone the dev repository
git clone https://github.com/mlhale/nebraska-gencyber-dev-env

# Switch to the cloned repository
cd nebraska-gencyber-dev-env/


git submodule sync
git submodule update --init --recursive --remote
cd backend/
git checkout tags/step-10-server

```

### Step 2: Examine the included DockerFile

In ```Powershell```:
```bash
# Switch to the cloned repo directory
cd ~/Desktop/nebraska-gencyber-dev-env
# Examine the DockerFile
get-content Dockerfile
```

### Step 3: Build the image

In ```Powershell```:
```bash
# Use the `build` command and supply a DockerFile
# `-t` option provides a name and tag for the image
docker build -t django:dev .
# List local images
docker images
```
> If the build is successful,  `django` appears in your local image listing

## Cleanup

Here is how to delete the image we just created.  
In ```Powershell```:
```bash
# Use the `rmi` command and supply an image name
docker rmi django:dev
# List local images
docker images
```
> If the command is successful,  `django` is removed from your local image listing

> Tip: To delete a container, use the command ```docker rm container-name```

## Automating Multi-Container Application Build

Apps may require additional services in their environment. For example a Database Service

The `docker-compose` tool automates building your app‚Äôs services all at once
and links them as described in a `docker-compose.yml` file

## Django with Postgres Database

`docker-compose.yml` file:

```bash
# Compose file format version
version: "3"
# Declare services
services:
  # Name of the Postgres Database service
  db:
    # Behavior upon container exit
    restart: always
    # Base image is postgres
    image: postgres
    # Per-service volume list
    volumes:
      - postgres-config:/etc/postgresql
      - postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
      - postgres-logs:/var/log/postgresql
      - ./database-backup:/database-backup
  # Name of the Django service
  django:
    # Use the Dockerfile to build this image
    build: .
    # Overide the default command
    command: python /var/www/backend/manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
    # Per-service volume list
    volumes:
      - ./backend:/var/www/backend
    # Expose ports
    ports:
     - "80:8000"
    # Link Django to Postgres
    depends_on:
     - db
# Declare named volumes
volumes:
  # These keys are left empty to use docker engine defaults
  postgres-config:
  postgres-data:
  postgres-logs:
```

## Building with Docker-Compose

The `docker-compose` tool can build containers with a single command.  

In a new ```Powershell```:
```bash
# Switch to project directory
cd nebraska-gencyber-dev-env
# build images
docker-compose build
# List local images
docker images
```

> If the build is successful, `nebraskagencyberdevenv_django` appears in your local image listing.
Services are built once and then tagged, by default as `projectname_service`

# Easy Peasy üòè

## Run the App

Before running the built containers, often additional configuration steps are needed.  
The steps below are specific to our setup and will vary with applications

In the previous ```Powershell```:
```bash
# run option executes a one-time command against a service
docker-compose run django bash
```

In the returned ```container``` shell:
```bash
# Perform Django configurations
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser --username admin --email admin
exit
```

Back in the previous ```Powershell```:
```bash
# One simple command to start the entire application
docker-compose up
```

Navigate to http://localhost to examine the running app.

# Super cool ü§ì

## Shutting down multiple containers

While pressing CRTL+C in the terminal once will shutdown the containers, here is a better way.

In a new ```Powershell```
```bash
# Examine running containers
docker ps
# Gracefully shutdown the containers
cd nebraska-gencyber-dev-env
docker-compose stop
```
> `docker-compose down` command will shutdown and delete the containers. So be careful when using the down command.

#### Profit!
Pretty neat. Observe your handy work.
