# CYBR4580/8950 Project Milestone 2: Non-trival Deliverable Increment
**Total 330 points**

## Due Date
October 29th by class time

**Submit a GitHub repo link to canvas**
**Add Dr. Hale as a collaborator on your GitHub Repo**

## Overview
This project milestone tasks you with producing your first major deliverable. Since every project is different the requirements stated below are as generally applicable as possible.

- [Setup Environments](#environment-setup) - Establish needed tooling and work environments
- [Project realization](#project-realization) - Clearly document your efforts towards achieving the project methodology.
  - Identify tasks achieved from your backlog
  - Document the product increments (an agile term for the things you produce) generated in this milestone
  - Bind tasks, code artifacts, and documentation together
- [Visual understanding (aka diagrams)](#diagrams) - Encapsulate your efforts diagrammatically
- [Next Milestone planning](#next-milestone-plan) - Create a plan on your kanban board for your next milestone
- [Presentation](#presentation) - Present your progress to the class

## Environment setup
Regardless of the type of project you are working on, you will need some work environments. You should determine tooling needs, document their usage/installation/configuration and include that information in your project repostiory.

### Submission materials
Include your setup instructions in your main repository-level README.md file. The instructions should provide a clear pathway to setting up and configuring needed tools to begin working on your project. For maker-based projects this might be software dependencies and coding libraries or establishing some build files (in something like Docker). For breaker-based projects it might be creating VMs or docker containers to containerize the target of investigations.

#### Grading Criteria
Your team will be graded as follows:

| | Meets expectations (27-30) | Some Issues (16-26) | Does not meet expectations (0-15)|
|---|---|---|---|
| Documentation | Documentation is clear and concise, but provides sufficient detail to understand the basic setup details. | Some documentation exists, but it is piecemeal or not entirely clear. | Little or no setup/configuration documentation or it is very hard to follow.|
| Works as expected | Installation instructions work as expected and correctly setup needed tooling/environments.  | Some minor problems during setup, but instructions mostly work. | Many significant issues in instructions makes setup difficult or impossible. |

**Total 60 points.**

## Project realization
The bulk of the project work is centered on realizing the methodology you defined in Milestone 1. Here, you should identify the tasks you have achieved, document the product or other intellectual/applied outcomes that have resulted from your efforts, and bind your tasks to the outcomes and documentation you have produced so far.

Be productive, work towards completing your process, and document what you do.

Documentation towards project realization will come in the form an intermediate project report. Your project report should be placed on GitHub in the same repository you used for Milestone 1. Create a new markdown file that contains the following.

```markdown
# Progress Report (insert date here)
## Overview
(insert brief overview of efforts made)

## Outcomes
(brief overview of outcomes - what did you achieve?)

also list them out like this:
* outcome 1
* outcome 2

## Hinderances
(insert brief discussion of challenges encountered)

## Ongoing Risks
(address your project risks identified from Milestone 1 and update them based on your current progress, this should be a table)


```

### Submission materials
For this submission, you should submit your progress report as a `.md` file in your project GitHub repository

#### Grading Criteria
Your team will be graded as follows:

| | Meets expectations (33-40) | Some Issues (25-32) | Does not meet expectations (0-24)|
|---|---|---|---|
| Effort and progress | It is clear that the team has made non-trivial effort and progress towards project realization.| There is some evidence of effort and progress, but more could have been done in the time. | Little effort or progress was made.|
| Documentation | Code artifacts and tasks are documented well. Documentation is clear and illustrative. | Some code is documented, but large portions are not. | Little or no documentation.|
| Demonstrable Outcomes | The outcomes are successfully demoed for Dr. Hale. The team addresses and handles questions well. | The demo partially works, but there are some significant issues. | Many significant issues with artifacts (e.g. code, documents, etc).|


**Total 120 points.**

## Diagrams
In addition to the project documentation, you should produce a set of process or conceptual diagrams suited to your project. This could be a set of activity diagrams for penetration-testing oriented projects, it could be software architecture diagrams for development-oriented projects, or it could be a process/conceptual model for other projects.

For more information about different types of diagrams, see:

### Submission materials
You should create your diagrams using an architectural tool such as Lucidchart, MS Visio, or similar tools. You should include the diagrams in your main project README.md file and in your Progress report in your GitHub repo, as images and (where appropriate) include links to Lucidchart/other platforms.

### Grading Criteria
You should produce diagrams relevant to your project. Diagrams will be graded as follows:

| | Meets expectations (27-30) | Some Issues (16-26) | Does not meet expectations (0-15)|
|---|---|---|---|
| Relevant | The diagrams are useful for conveying project details. | There are some issues that prevent the diagrams from contributing to understanding | The diagrams are tangential or not present. |
| Descriptive | The diagrams clarify the interoperation or operation of a feature of interest. They provides descriptive clarity. | The diagrams provides limited descriptive clarity. | The diagrams do not help the viewer understand the project. |

**Total 60 points.**


## Next Milestone planning
Plan the next milestone. In the next (and final milestone) - you will 1) continue to work towards realizing your methodology, 2) polish your product/outcomes and prepare them for release, and 3) aggregate your results into a single final report for release to vendors or other relevant entities.

### Submission materials
This part of the milestone is strictly captured by your Kanban board. In your Kanban board, create a board following the structure used in Milestone 1. Use this structure to identify the tasks that you will tackle in your next sprint. Put those tasks in the **Sprint To-do** category.

### Grading Criteria
**Total 30 points.**

## Presentation
You will be expected to present your Milestone 2 achievements to the class following the deadline. It is important that you use this time to both inform your classmates of your activities and to practice for your final presentation. Things to be considered are 1) conveying a sense of interest and excitement about your project 2) cool product demos, and 3) interesting findings of conducting your projects.

### Submission Materials
Submit your slides to Dr. Hale by the presentation days (TBA on slack). Submit them by posting and pinning them in your team slack channel.

### Grading Criteria
You will be graded by a presentation rubric TBA.
