## Overview
This project milestone tasks you with producing your final major deliverable. Since every project is different the requirements stated below are as generally applicable as possible.

- [Project realization](#project-realization) - Clearly document your efforts towards achieving the project methodology.
  - Identify tasks achieved from your backlog
  - Document the product increments (an agile term for the things you produce) generated in this milestone
  - Bind tasks, code artifacts, and documentation together
- [Packaging and Release](#packaging-and-release) - Package all of your product deliverables, results, and outcomes for release
- [Presentation](#presentation) - Present your progress to the class and your external partner



## Project realization
Here, you should identify the tasks you have achieved, document the product or other intellectual/applied outcomes that have resulted from your efforts, and bind your tasks to the outcomes and documentation you have produced so far.

Be productive, work towards completing your process, and document what you do.

Documentation towards project realization will come in the form a project report. Your project report should be placed on GitHub in the same repository you used for Milestones 1 and 2. Create a new markdown file called `milestone-3.md` that contains the following.

```markdown
# Progress Report (insert date here)
## Overview
(insert brief overview of efforts made)

## Outcomes
(brief overview of outcomes - what did you achieve?)

also list them out like this:
* outcome 1
* outcome 2

## Hinderances
(insert brief discussion of challenges encountered)


```

### Submission materials
For this submission, you should submit your progress report as a `.md` file in your project GitHub repository

#### Grading Criteria
Your team will be graded as follows:

| | Meets expectations (33-40) | Some Issues (25-32) | Does not meet expectations (0-24)|
|---|---|---|---|
| Effort and progress | It is clear that the team has made non-trivial effort and progress towards project realization.| There is some evidence of effort and progress, but more could have been done in the time. | Little effort or progress was made.|
| Documentation | Code artifacts and tasks are documented well. Documentation is clear and illustrative. | Some code is documented, but large portions are not. | Little or no documentation.|

**Total 80 points.**


## Final Report: Packaging and Release
An important part of developing or assessing a product is making the product or results accessible to those that might want to use it or them. This part of the final milestone tasks you with preparing your product, code, processes, and/or other relevant results for release by using relevant deployment strategies and by creating appropriate companion documentation. It is expected that every team will create a final report for release and review by partnering companies and organizations. All projects with code or other requirements must prepare a list of installation instructions and run instructions necessary to install and run any required apps.

### Code artifact Expectations
Expectations:
 * Polish your product by squashing as many bugs as possible and cleaning up the user interface.
 * Package your code and/or deployment environment for release using relevant deployment solutions such as [github](https://github.com/), [docker](https://www.docker.com/), [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/creating-node-modules), [bower](https://bower.io/docs/creating-packages/), [apt-get](https://help.launchpad.net/Packaging/PPA), [Python pip](https://packaging.python.org/distributing/), etc. The simplist deployment solution is creating a github repository that is cloneable and has a few short install instructions. Other solutions like docker can be helpful in situations where the deployment environment context is complex or depends on certain versions of supporting software. Others like npm, bower, apt-get, or pip are useful for libraries that others might want to install or add to their own projects.
 * Create ```installation``` and ```getting started``` instructions using markdown in their repository or documentation to detail what an end-user must do to setup their app or product.

### Results and findings Expectations
 * Summarize your results discovered over the life of the project.
 * Summarize findings as they relate to the original proposal in milestone 1. What worked, what didn't work? Where would future work be most useful?
 * The report should arrange documentation generated over the project timeline in a logical way that supports the summary. Think of the final report as a compilation of all of your work over the semester. 
 
A suggested format for the final report is as follows:

```markdown
# Project name
## Executive Summary
(overview of project, reuse from milestone 1, update if scope changed)

## Project Goals
(high level project goals, reuse from milestone 1, update if scope changed)

## Project Methodology
(specific methodology followed in the project, reuse from milestone 1/2, update if scope changed)

## Results / Findings
(brief overview of outcomes - what did you achieve?, list milestone 1/2/3 outcomes, make an effort to logically collect and organize the findings)

(bulleted lists can also be helpful to structure your results discussion)
* outcome 1
* outcome 2

## Install Instructions (if applicable)
### Requirements
(list of any software / hardware requirements necessary to run the code/app/etc)

### Installation Instructions
(list of steps to install the product/app/code/etc)

### Getting started
(list of any steps to run the code after installation and/or manage the apps over their lifecycle)


```

### Submission materials
For this submission, you should submit your final report as a `.md` file called `finalreport.md` in your project GitHub repository. You should also convert the md file to pdf and upload it as `finalreport.pdf` for use on other non-web-based file stores. 

### Grading Criteria
| | Meets expectations (33-40) | Some Issues (25-32) | Does not meet expectations (0-24)|
|---|---|---|---|
|Polish|Team has made clear efforts to prepare the product/app for release. | Some bugs or user interface oddities are present, but overall the product is reasonably polished. | The product is not ready for release. |
|Packaging and Deployment| The product is packaged and ready to be shipped using one or more deployment solutions. | Some effort has been made to package code and resources, but the deployment isn't fully successful. | Little to no effort has been made to package the product/code for release. |
|Installation and Getting Started Documentation| Installation and Getting started instructions work as stated without error. | Some instructions are missing or incorrect. | Installation and getting started instructions are missing or do not work.|
|Activity and Findings Summary| Findings from project activities have been summaried at a high level and are presented in a tabular or graphical format that is easy to read and understand. | Findings are missing from the summary or are difficult to read and understand as presented. | Little or no efforts were made to summarize findings. |
|Final Report Structure|The team prepares an overall report from existing documentation generated during the project. The report includes the assessment and finding summaries and connects the findings to existing documentation in the project repository. |Some report items are missing, or the report does not link to all activities and findings. | Little effort has been made to compile results of semester-long activities and results.|

**Total 200 points.**

## Presentation
You will be expected to present your Final Milestone to the class on our final day. There may be external guests present as well. A project presentation agenda will be released before the presentation day. Project teams will have 20 minutes to present. 

Your presentation should cover:
 * High level goals
 * Project methodology overview
 * Project findings
 * Demos of any relevant tooling / code / attacks / etc that resulted from the work and/or findings
 
### Submission Materials
Submit your slides to Drs. Hale / Mahoney as part of your overall submission on the day of the presentation. Submit them by uploading them in your project github repository.

### Grading Criteria
Presentations will be graded using the following rubric. Each student on a team is expected to contribute to and help deliver the presentation.

* Note that Demos may include videos if the conditions necessary to replicate the demo cannot be re-created in a live in-class demo.
