# Structured Abstracts
Structured abstracts are a certain type of annotated bibliography that uses a standard series of concrete questions to scaffold knowledge about a paper and aggregate it into a form that makes it useful for later parts of the research process.

The following three slides do a nice job of characterizing the process of structured abstract generation. The slides were created by Dr. Robin Gandhi in conjunction with the [Cybersecurity Skills Journal](https://www.csj.nationalcyberwatch.org/).
